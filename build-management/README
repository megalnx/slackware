A shell script for automate the process of building 
Slackware packages from slackbuilds.org


The location of the retrieved source files can be set using the SVAS_DOWNLOAD,
a subfolder is created according to the category of the package.

If not defined output package is stored at /tmp, if you want to change it
define SBo_OUTPUT, which also creates a folder structure with two
subfolders levels first with the release version and the second as the package
category.


Usage: slackbuild-management.sh search|info|download|download-sources|pack|install packagename
  search - search for a package
  info - show the SlackBuilds info
  download - get SlackBuilds files
  download-sources - get package source files
  pack - download and build the SlackBuilds
  install - install package
 * update - updates local SlackBuilds index

 
Building enviroment variables:
 - TMP_DIR : Changes the temp folder
 - SBo_OUTPUT : where to save the output package, defaults (/tmp). If declared,
the package category is appended. For example:
# SBo_OUTPUT=/mnt/localbuilds ./slackbuild-management.sh pack colordiff
Generates the following output:
# Slackware package /mnt/localbuilds/./development/colordiff-1.0.15-noarch-1_SBo.tgz created.

 - ADDON : any additional parameters passed to PRGNAM.SlackBuild
